Using Juypter Notebook and Python, extracting relational data and merging them using Pandas Framework and generating charts with Bokeh.

## Project Details:
In this project, I have collected data from the GoodReads website(www.goodreads.com). Stored all the data in 2 seperate CSV files. Then using Pandas Framework, made pandas data models for each CSV file. Merged the pandas data models and then Visualized the data by using Bokeh.   

## Technology:
- **Python** -  Python 2.7.12
- **Scrapy** - A Fast and Powerful Web-Crawler Framework - Uses Python
- **Pandas** - A Fast, Flexible, and Expressive data structures for Relational Data 
- **Bokeh**  - A Python Interactive Visualization library

## Relavant Files: 
- **Books.py**: This file extracts the details of the Books from GoodReads(https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=authors)
- **authors.py**: This file extracts the details of the Authors from GoodReads(https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=authors)

## How to Run:
- Download/Clone the files from the repository. 
- Open the terminal and type _juyter notebook_ this opens up the web browser, then open **_MergeRelationalData.ipynb_** notebook which has the detailed explanation of the code.
